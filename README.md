# Technic Fabric Server

Runs on Minecraft 1.18.1. Has some IndustrialCraft-like and BuildCraft-like things. Get Fabric loader from [FabricMC.net](https://fabricmc.net/), save it here as `server.jar` and run `./run` to start the server. You will have to accept the EULA after the first run by editing `eula.txt`. The server is configured for offline mode.
